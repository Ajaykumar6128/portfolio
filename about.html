    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Ajaykumar, and I am from Dharmapuri District, Tamil Nadu. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Varuvan Vadivelan Institute of Technology, as part of the 2024 batch.</p>

    <p>After completing my degree, I pursued a certification course in Python Full Stack Development to enhance my technical skills. I am passionate about programming, with strong interest in both frontend and backend development.</p>

    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>I enjoy watching the news and learning new things that help me grow personally and professionally. For relaxation and creativity, I watch movies. I'm known as a compassionate and collaborative person who believes in lifelong learning and empathy.</p>

    <h2>Vision & Ambition</h2>
    <p>My goal is to live a purposeful and fulfilling life through consistent effort. I aim to become a successful, respected professional making meaningful contributions to my field and society.</p>

    <h2>My View</h2>
    <p class="quote">"A meaningful life is not about being rich, being popular, being highly educated, or being perfect… It’s about being real, being humble, and being kind."</p>
